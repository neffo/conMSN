* fixed issue with process_cmd(), basically any single word cmd was ignored 
unless it was followed with a space (it was stupidly expecting 
string_to_args() to return 2 args)

July 18, 2002:
* updated AddUserToChatList() so as to set the state of the user to online.
there is still the issue with changing user states however, for instance,
someone becoming away or logging off. more than likely its an issue with
incorrect handling of the two separate chatlists. possible way to resolve this
is to use ChatLists instead of our own storage methods for user states.
* added msn_show_typing cvar

July 16, 2002:
* actually works, ie send and recieve messages
