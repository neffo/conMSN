( + really important    - fairly important    X - done)

+ CLEAN UP CODE (remove redundancy, etc)
+ Test the bloody thing (especially the setup_fds() function and those 
	related to it) (kinda DONE: setup_fds() appears to work as it should)
+ add debug output for all functions to properly test what the hell is going on
	and whats going wrong (err_printf() is used for this) / check function
	return values
X add support for external commands on events ( message, user coming online, 
	etc) (kinda DONE)
- give it a name
X scrolling contact list (DONE)
- multiuser chat stuff (going to be a bitch)
- view user profiles (using links or whatever) && view hotmail inbox
- move commands (do_*) to separate file
X add autoaway code (DONE)
X fix cvar code (use mlists?) (DONE)
- allow resizing of windows (ie contact list) && automagic resizing on xterm 
	resize
- along the same line, have a dynamically resizing command line window, to allow
	for multiline messages and the like (ie. IN_BLOCK input type)
- do proper clean up on exit (is this actually necessary?)
- use mlists for commands as well ? (kinda goes with macros - below)
X user defined macros (DONE)
X initial run setup (set username and password, create directory and so forth) 
	(DONE)
+ ability to set aliases for users (DONE) and work out how to get user specified 
	aliases from the server - probably something to do with an unimplemented
	MSN command, because we don't get offline users either
+ fix user tab completion so that it completes aliases (plus add conversion for 
	other functions)
X fix contact list corruption when scrolling main window (DONE - see 
	msn_correct_graphics cvar)
- allow user to use commands even when in a chat ( by adding a "/" in front of 
	the command)
+ do bash style tab completion (show possible completions)
X write macros to file on exit and read in on startup (DONE)
- mouse support :)
+ find all mistaken uses of MSN_Conn when it should be msn_sess_conn_t (ie when
	handling MSNshiz.conn.cnx). in order to get MSN_Conn pointer you need to
	use the conn part of the msn_conn_sess_t type. (DONE-ish)
- rework the handling of connections, because MSN multiuser chats are apprently indistinguishable from single user chats
